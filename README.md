# advancedRegressionCourseIllustration

This repository contains R code illustrating elements from an advanced regression course. This is an RShiny app, so there are two files essential to the program ui.R and server.R. The last file just contains the excecution command. Please note that RStudio has a button launching the app. Please also consider that to make the app work, the two R files MUST be in the exact same directory.
